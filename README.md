Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a progressive condition where the kidneys lose their ability to filter waste and excess fluids from the blood. Early detection is crucial to prevent severe complications, including kidney failure. Machine learning (ML) techniques can help predict CKD by analyzing medical data such as blood pressure, creatinine levels, and proteinuria patterns.

This project aims to develop an ML model that accurately classifies patients as CKD or non-CKD based on clinical parameters. Using supervised learning algorithms, feature selection techniques, and model evaluation metrics, the project seeks to enhance early diagnosis and support healthcare professionals in decision-making.










## **ðŸ“„Description**
- Models Used: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) and many more models are used to figure out the best accuracy model
- Features Analyzed: some features where dropped and some where analysed, for better prediction
- Model Evaluation: Models were evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Best Performing Model: MLP And Decision-Tree is found to be the most accurate and interpretable model for predicting.
